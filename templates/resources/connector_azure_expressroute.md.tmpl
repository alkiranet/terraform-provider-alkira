## Understanding Connector Components

### 1. Connector Base Configuration

The connector requires basic information such as:
- Name and description
- Size (from SMALL to 10LARGE)
- CXP location (where the connector is provisioned)
- VHUB prefix (a /23 CIDR block for the virtual hub)
- Tunnel protocol (VXLAN, VXLAN_GPE, or IPSEC)

### 2. ExpressRoute Circuit Instances

Each connector must have at least one ExpressRoute circuit instance, which specifies:
- Circuit identifier from Azure
- Loopback subnet (/26) for establishing VXLAN GPE tunnels
- Azure credentials
- Optional redundant router configuration
- For VXLAN: Gateway MAC addresses and optional virtual network interfaces
- For IPsec: Segment-specific gateway and tunnel configurations

### 3. Segment Options

Segment options define routing parameters for each network segment, including:
- Customer ASN (Autonomous System Number)
- Internet exit controls
- On-premises route advertisement options

## Important Notes

- The VHUB prefix must be a `/23` CIDR block
- The loopback subnet must be a `/26` CIDR block
- For VXLAN with redundant routers, two gateway MAC addresses are required
- For IPsec tunnels, at least one customer gateway with one tunnel is required per segment
- Currently, only IKEv2 and FQDN authentication are supported for IPsec tunnels
- **Segment mapping requirement**: There must be a one-to-one correspondence between segments defined in instance-level `segment_options` and global-level `segment_options`.
  Every segment referenced within an instance must also have a corresponding global segment options entry with the same segment name.
