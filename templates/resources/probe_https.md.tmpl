The `alkira_probe_https` resource allows you to configure and manage HTTPS probes in the Alkira network. 
HTTPS probes provide secure monitoring of TLS/SSL-enabled endpoints by periodically sending HTTPS 
requests and evaluating responses based on configurable validation criteria. 
This resource supports advanced TLS options like certificate validation, SNI, and custom CA certificates.
Connection will always be initiated to the EIPs associated with the Internet Application, 
the host specified in the uri will be added to the host header

~>**NOTE:**   This is a non-provisionable resource.
