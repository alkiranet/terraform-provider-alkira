# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

{{ .Description | trimspace }}

This resource is usually used along with `terraform-provider-aws`.

## Routing Options

Either `vpc_cidr` or `vpc_subnet` needs to be specified for routing
purpose.  If `vpc_cidr` is provided, it will automatically select all
associated subnets of the given VPC. Otherwise, you can select
certain subnets by specifying `vpc_subnet`.

`vpc_route_tables` can be used to adjust the routing options against
the specified route tables. When `OVERRIDE_DEFAULT_ROUTE` is
specified, the existing default route will be overwritten and the
traffic will be routed to Alkira CXP.  When `ADVERTISE_CUSTOM_PREFIX`
is specified, you need to provide a list of prefixes for which traffic
must be routed to Alkira CXP.

When `vpc_cidr` is used, `vpc_route_tables` should be also specified
to ensure that the traffic is attracted to the CXP.


## Tips

* Changing an existing connector to a new AWS VPC is not supported at
  this point. You need to create a new connector for a new AWS VPC.

* Updating an existing connector requires the tenant network to be
  re-provisioned to make the change effective, e.g. changing the
  segment the connector is associated.

* When direct inter VPC communication is enabled, several other
  functionalities won't work, like NAT policy, segment resource share,
  internet-facing applications and traffic policies.


## Example Usage

This is one simple minimal example to create an AWS VPC connector. One
`alkira_segment` and `alkira_credential_aws_vpc` are always required.

To create a connector and adjust the routing to use the default
route. Multiple `vpc_route_table` blocks can be used for additional
route tables:
