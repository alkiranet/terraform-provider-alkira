## Schema

### Required

- `credential_id` (String) ID of PAN credential managed by credential resource.
- `cxp` (String) The CXP where the service should be provisioned.
- `instance` (Block List, Min: 1) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--instance))
- `license_type` (String) PAN license type, either `BRING_YOUR_OWN` or `PAY_AS_YOU_GO`.
- `management_segment_id` (Number) Management Segment ID.
- `max_instance_count` (Number) Max number of Panorama instances for auto scale.
- `name` (String) Name of the PAN service.
- `registration_pin_expiry` (String) PAN Registration PIN Expiry. The date should be in format of `YYYY-MM-DD`, e.g. `2000-01-01`.
- `registration_pin_id` (String) PAN Registration PIN ID.
- `registration_pin_value` (String) PAN Registration PIN Value.
- `segment_ids` (List of Number) IDs of segments associated with the service.
- `size` (String) The size of the service, one of `SMALL`, `MEDIUM`, `LARGE`, `2LARGE`, `4LARGE`, `5LARGE`, `10LARGE`, `20LARGE`.
- `type` (String) The type of the PAN firewall.
- `version` (String) The version of the PAN firewall.

### Optional

- `billing_tag_ids` (List of Number) Billing tag IDs to associate with the service.
- `bundle` (String) The software image bundle that would be used forPAN instance deployment. This is applicable for licenseType`PAY_AS_YOU_GO` only. If not provided, the default`PAN_VM_300_BUNDLE_2` would be used. However `PAN_VM_300_BUNDLE_2`is legacy bundle and is not supported on AWS. It is recommendedto use `VM_SERIES_BUNDLE_1` and `VM_SERIES_BUNDLE_2` (supports Global Protect).
- `global_protect_enabled` (Boolean) Enable global protect option or not. Default is `false`
- `global_protect_segment_options` (Block Set) A mapping of segment_id -> segment_options. The only segment names allowed are the segments that are already associated with the service.options should apply. If global_protect_enabled is set to false, global_protect_segment_options shound not be included in your request. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--global_protect_segment_options))
- `license_sub_type` (String) PAN sub license type, either `CREDIT_BASED` or `MODEL_BASED`. (BETA)
- `master_key` (String) Master Key for PAN instances.
- `master_key_enabled` (Boolean) Enable Master Key for PAN instances or not. It's default to `false`.
- `master_key_expiry` (String) PAN Master Key Expiry. The date should be in format of `YYYY-MM-DD`, e.g. `2000-01-01`.

- `name` (String) The name of the PAN instance.

Optional:

- `global_protect_segment_options` (Block Set) These options should be set only when global protect is enabled on service. These are set per segment. It is expected that on a segment where global protect is enabled at least 1 instance should be set with portal_enabled and at least one with gateway_enabled. It can be on the same instance or a different instance under the segment. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--instance--global_protect_segment_options))
