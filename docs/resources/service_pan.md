Manage PAN firewall.

## Example Usage

```terraform

  name                  = "test1"
  credential_id         = alkira_credential_pan.test1.id
  cxp                   = "US-WEST"
  license_type          = "BRING_YOUR_OWN"
  management_segment_id = alkira_segment.segment1.id
  panorama_enabled      = "false"
  panorama_device_group = "alkira-test"
  panorama_ip_address   = "172.16.0.8"
  panorama_template     = "test"
  segment_ids           = [alkira_segment.segment1.id, alkira_segment.segment2.id]
  size                  = "SMALL"
  type                  = "VM-300"
  version               = "9.0.5-xfr"

  instance {
    name = "instance1"

## Schema

### Required

- **credential_id** (String) ID of PAN credential managed by credential resource.
- **cxp** (String) The CXP where the service should be provisioned.
- **global_protect_enabled** (Boolean) Enable global protect option or not. Default is `false`
- **instance** (Block Set, Min: 1) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--instance))
- **license_type** (String) PAN license type, either `BRING_YOUR_OWN` or `PAY_AS_YOU_GO`.
- **management_segment_id** (Number) Management Segment ID.
- **max_instance_count** (Number) Max number of Panorama instances for auto scale.
- **name** (String) Name of the PAN service.
- **segment_ids** (List of Number) IDs of segments associated with the service.
- **size** (String) The size of the service, one of `SMALL`, `MEDIUM`, `LARGE`.

- **version** (String) The version of the PAN firewall.

### Optional

- **billing_tag_ids** (List of Number) Billing tag IDs to associate with the service.

It is recommendedto use `VM_SERIES_BUNDLE_1` and `VM_SERIES_BUNDLE_2` (supports Global Protect).
- **global_protect_segment_options** (Block Set) A mapping of segment_name -> zones_to_groups. The only segment names allowed are the segments that are already associated with the service.options should apply. If global_protect_enabled is set to false, global_protect_segment_options shound not be included in your request. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--global_protect_segment_options))
- **id** (String) The ID of this resource.
- **min_instance_count** (Number) Minimal number of Panorama instances for auto scale. Default value is `0`.
- **panorama_device_group** (String) Panorama device group.
- **panorama_enabled** (Boolean) Enable Panorama or not. Default value is `false`.
- **panorama_ip_address** (String) Panorama IP address.
- **panorama_template** (String) Panorama Template.
