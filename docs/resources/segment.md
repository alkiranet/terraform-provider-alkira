# alkira_segment (Resource)

Provides segment resource.

A Segment is a section of a network isolated from one another to make it possible
to more effectively control who has access to what. Segmentation also allows for
segregation of resources between segments for security and isolation purposes.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "alkira_segment" "test" {
  name  = "test-segment"
  asn   = "65513"
  cidrs = ["10.16.1.0/24", "10.1.1.0/24"]
}
```
