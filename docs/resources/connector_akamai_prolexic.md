# alkira_connector_akamai_prolexic (Resource)

Manage Connector for Akamai Prolexic.

This resource is still under active development. It may have further changes in the near future. Today, to use this connector, you will need to have onboarded a BYOIP with Do Not Advertise set to `true`. Also, the segment with public IPs needs to be reported to Akamai Representative.

## Example Usage

```terraform
#
# This example assumes that resource "alkira_group", "alkira_segment"
# and "alkira_byoip_prefix" are created separately.
#
resource "alkira_connector_akamai_prolexic" "test" {
  name           = "tftest"
  cxp            = "US-WEST"
  group          = alkira_group.test.name
  segment_id     = alkira_segment.test.id
  size           = "SMALL"

  akamai_bgp_asn = 65514
  akamai_bgp_authentication_key = "xxxxxx"

  byoip_options {
    byoip_prefix_id = alkira_byoip_prefix.test.id
    enable_route_advertisement = true
  }

  tunnel_configuration {
    alkira_public_ip = "192.168.1.1"

    tunnel_ips {
      ran_tunnel_ip = "172.16.1.10"
      alkira_overlay_tunnel_ip  = "8.8.8.8"
      akamai_overlay_tunnel_ip  = "192.168.1.1"
    }

    tunnel_ips {
      ran_tunnel_ip = "172.16.1.20"
      alkira_overlay_tunnel_ip  = "8.8.8.8"
      akamai_overlay_tunnel_ip  = "192.168.1.1"
    }

    tunnel_ips {
      ran_tunnel_ip = "172.16.1.30"
      alkira_overlay_tunnel_ip  = "8.8.8.8"
      akamai_overlay_tunnel_ip  = "192.168.1.1"
    }
  }
}
```
