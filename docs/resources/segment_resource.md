# alkira_segment_resource (Resource)

Manage segment resource

To use this resource, you will need to use or create `alkira_group`, `alkira_segment` and `alkira_policy_prefix_list`. There could be multiple `group_prefix` section defined as needed. The `group_prefix` should be defined like this:

* ANY -> ANY:  where `group_id` must be `-1` and prefix_list_id must be `-1`. When an ANY -> ANY mapping is present then it should be the only mapping in the group_prefix

* EXPLICIT Group -> ANY:  where `group_id` must be the ID of group of type EXPLICIT and prefix_list_id MUST be `-1`.

* IMPLICIT Group -> ANY: where group_id must be the ID of group of type IMPLICIT, this is also known as a Connector Group and `prefix_list_id` must be `-1`. If an IMPLICIT group is mapped to ANY `prefix_list_id`, then an IMPLICIT Group -> `prefix_list_id` must NOT be present in `group_prefix`

* IMPLICIT Group -> PrefixList ID: where `group_id` must be the ID of group of type IMPLICIT and `prefix_list_id` MUST be the ID of an existing `prefix_list_id`

* SERVICE Group -> ANY: where `group_id` must be the ID of group of type SERVICE and `prefix_list_id` MUST be -1.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "alkira_segment_resource" "test" {
  name       = "test"
  segment_id = alkira_segment.tftest.id

  group_prefix {
    group_id       = -1
    prefix_list_id = -1
  }
}
```
