  There are two options for providing the required license key for Fortinet instance credentials. You can either input the value directly into the license_key field or provide the file path for the license key file using the license_key_file_path. Either license_key and license_key_file_path must have an input. If both are provided, the Alkira provider will treat the license_key field with precedence.
  You may also use terraform's built in file helper function as a literal input for license_key. Ex: license_key = file('/path/to/license/file').

# alkira_credential_fortinet_instance (Resource)

There are two options for providing the required license key for Fortinet instance credentials. You can either input the value directly into the `license_key` field or provide the file path for the license key file using the `license_key_file_path`. Either `license_key` and `license_key_file_path` must have an input. If both are provided, the Alkira provider will treat the `license_key` field with precedence. 


 You may also use terraform's built in `file` helper function as a literal input for `license_key`. Ex: `license_key = file('/path/to/license/file')`.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "alkira_credential_fortinet_instance" "tf_test_fortinet-instance" {
  name         = "tf-test-fortinet-instance"
  license_type = "PAY_AS_YOU_GO"
  license_key  = "test-license_type"
}
```
