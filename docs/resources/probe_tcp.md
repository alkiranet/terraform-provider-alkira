# alkira_probe_tcp (Resource)

Manage Alkira TCP Probe.

The `alkira_probe_tcp` resource allows you to configure and manage TCP probes in the Alkira network. 
TCP probes verify fundamental network connectivity by attempting to establish TCP connections to 
specified ports on target services. These probes are ideal for monitoring basic connectivity, port availability, 
and service reachability without the overhead of HTTP/HTTPS application-layer checks.
When used with InternetApplication both the EIPs associated with the network entity will be probed



## Example Usage

### Basic TCP Probe
This example demonstrates a simple TCP probe that verifies web server connectivity:
```terraform
resource "alkira_probe_tcp" "basic_tcp" {
  name              = "basic-tcp-probe"
  network_entity_id = alkira_internet_application.example_application.id
  port              = 80
}
```

### TCP Probe with Custom Parameters
This example shows a TCP probe with custom thresholds and timing parameters:
```terraform
resource "alkira_probe_tcp" "full_tcp" {
  name              = "tcp-full-options"
  enabled           = true
  network_entity_id = alkira_internet_application.example_application.id
  port              = 443
  failure_threshold = 5
  success_threshold = 3
  period_seconds    = 20
  timeout_seconds   = 5
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the TCP probe.
- `network_entity_id` (String) The ID of the internet application network entity to probe.
- `port` (Number) The TCP port to probe.

### Optional

- `description` (String) The description of the probe.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Whether the probe is enabled.
- `failure_threshold` (Number) The number of consecutive failures required to mark the probe as failed. Default is `3`, and the maximum value allowed is `50`.
- `period_seconds` (Number) How often (in seconds) to perform the probe. Default value is `60`, and the maximum value allowed is `360`.
- `success_threshold` (Number) The number of consecutive successes required to mark the probe as successful. Default value is `1`, and the maximum value allowed is `50`.
- `timeout_seconds` (Number) Number of seconds after which the probe times out. Default value is `60`, and the maximum value allowed is `360`. `timeout_seconds` should always be less than or equal to `period_seconds`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
