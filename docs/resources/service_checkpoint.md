# alkira_service_checkpoint (Resource)

Manage checkpoint services

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "alkira_service_checkpoint" "test" {
  name         = "test"

  auto_scale   = "ON"
  cxp          = "US-WEST"
  license_type = "PAY_AS_YOU_GO"
  size         = "SMALL"
  version      = "R80.30"
  pdp_ips      = ["10.0.0.1"]
  password     = "abcd1234"
  segment_id   = alkira_segment.test.id

  # max_instance_count and min_instance_count must equal each other
  # when auto_scale is off.
  max_instance_count = 2
  min_instance_count = 2

  instance {
    name    = "ins1"
    sic_key = "abcd1234"
  }

  instance {
    name    = "ins2"
    sic_key = "abcd12345"
  }

  management_server {
    type                = "MDS"
    configuration_mode  = "AUTOMATED"
    reachability        = "PRIVATE"
    ips                 = ["192.168.3.3"]
    global_cidr_list_id = alkira_list_global_cidr.test.id
    segment_id          = alkira_segment.test.id

    # user_name and management_server_password required only when
    # configuration_mode is AUTOMATED.
    user_name                  = "checkpoint_user"
    management_server_password = "abcd1234"

    # domain only required when configuration_mode is AUTOMATED and
    # when type is MDS.
    domain = "test.alkira.com"
  }
}

## Schema

### Required

- `cxp` (String) CXP region.
- `instance` (Block List, Min: 1) An array containing properties for each Checkpoint Firewall instance that needs to be deployed. The number of instances should be equal to `max_instance_count`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--instance))
- `license_type` (String) Checkpoint license type, either `BRING_YOUR_OWN` or `PAY_AS_YOU_GO`.
- `management_server` (Block Set, Min: 1) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--management_server))
- `max_instance_count` (Number) The maximum number of Checkpoint Firewall instances that should be deployed when auto-scale is enabled. Note that auto-scale is not supported with Checkpoint at this time. `max_instance_count` must be greater than or equal to `min_instance_count`. (**BETA**)
- `name` (String) Name of the Checkpoint Firewall service.
- `password` (String) The Checkpoint Firewall service password.
- `segment_id` (String) The ID of the segments associated with the service.
- `size` (String) The size of the service, one of `SMALL`, `MEDIUM`, `LARGE`.
- `version` (String) The version of the Checkpoint Firewall. Please check all supported versions from Alkira Portal.

### Optional

- `auto_scale` (String) Indicate if `auto_scale` should be enabled for your checkpoint firewall. `ON` and `OFF` are accepted values. `OFF` is the default if field is omitted
- `billing_tag_ids` (Set of Number) IDs of billing tags to be associate with the service.
- `description` (String) The description of the checkpoint service.
- `min_instance_count` (Number) The minimum number of Checkpoint Firewall instances that should be deployed at any point in time. If auto-scale is OFF, min_instance_count must equal max_instance_count.
- `pdp_ips` (List of String) The IPs of the PDP Brokers.
- `segment_options` (Block Set) The segment options as used by your Checkpoint firewall. No more than one segment option will be accepted. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--segment_options))
- `tunnel_protocol` (String) Tunnel Protocol, default to `IPSEC`, could be either `IPSEC` or `GRE`.

### Read-Only

- `credential_id` (String) ID of Checkpoint Firewall credential.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `provision_state` (String) The provision state of the resource.

<a id="nestedblock--instance"></a>
### Nested Schema for `instance`

Required:

- `name` (String) The name of the checkpoint instance.
- `sic_key` (String) The checkpoint instance sic keys.

Read-Only:

- `credential_id` (String) ID of Checkpoint Firewall Instance credential.
- `id` (Number) The ID of the checkpoint instance.


<a id="nestedblock--management_server"></a>
### Nested Schema for `management_server`

Required:

- `configuration_mode` (String) The configuration_mode specifies whether the firewall is to be automatically configured by Alkira or not.

- `segment_id` (String) The IDs of the segment to be used to access the management server.
- `username` (String) The username of the management server.

Read-Only:

- `credential_id` (String) ID of Checkpoint Firewall Managment server credential.


<a id="nestedblock--segment_options"></a>
### Nested Schema for `segment_options`

Required:

- `groups` (List of String) The list of Groups associated with the zone.
- `segment_id` (String) The ID of the segment.

Optional:

- `zone_name` (String) The name of the associated zone. Default value is `DEFAULT`.
