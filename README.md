# Terraform Provider for Alkira (private preview)

* Website: http://www.alkira.com

The Terraform provider for Alkira is a Terraform plugin to enable full
lifecycle management of Alkira resources. The provider is maintained
internally by Alkira engineering team.

Currently, the provider is still in early development phase and being
actively worked on.


## Requirements

-	[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.12.x
-	[Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.14.x (to build the provider plugin)


## Getting Started

To start using the provider, you will need Terraform 0.12.x and the
provider binary from the release page.

Since the provider is still private, please copy the
`terraform-provider-alkira` binary to `~/.terraform.d/plugins`.

Now, you could hover to the example directory to explore some
examples and start playing with the provider.
